# 🧠 Data Science Projects by Polina Voronina  

> A collection of my data-driven projects focused on analytics, predictive modeling, and business insights.  
> Each project demonstrates a complete data science workflow — from data preprocessing and EDA to model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 📊 Overview  

This repository showcases several independent projects I’ve developed.  
The main goals of these projects are to analyze patterns, build predictive models, and visualize data in an interpretable and actionable way.  

Each notebook follows a structured approach:  

1. **Problem Definition** – understanding the task and business context  
2. **Data Exploration (EDA)** – identifying patterns, correlations, and data quality issues  
3. **Feature Engineering** – preparing and transforming data for model input  
4. **Model Development** – training and tuning ML algorithms  
5. **Evaluation & Visualization** – interpreting metrics and presenting insights
